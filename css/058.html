    <p> two days
        <br>
        <br>
        two days, and six voice memos away from another heartache
        sitting alone in an empty bed, spent the whole night wide awake
        one day, and I am in season two. a show I don't even care about
        I can't believe all the things that came out of her pretty mouth
        
        my body's a haunted house. filled with the ghost of the past 
        
        can you blame me for it? how was I supposed to know
        I want a do over so I can go before her 
        
        I don't blame her for it. this is what young girls do 
        back where I started, feeling sad and lonely again
